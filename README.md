### Hello 👋

This is Astrit, a front-end developer based in Stockholm. 
Kind of addicted to CSS. I was crazy enough to create 700 CSS Icons on the open-source project CSS.GG.

Recently I started my YouTube jurney creating 2 videos a month related to front-end and CSS in general,
if you like the idea [subscribing](https://a.st/yt) would help me a lot ✌️

I also have a full time job as front-end developer at the award winning agency Sunny at Sea
