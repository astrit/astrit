### Hello 👋

This is Astrit, a self-taught front-end developer based in Stockholm, Sweden. 
Pundit wanna be when it comes to CSS, challanging my self to do objects, structures and animations by manipulating CSS props is my passion on daily basis.

I am the creator of the open-source project CSS.GG ( 700 CSS Icons ).


🧑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now:  
Recently I started my YouTube jurney creating 2 videos a month related to front-end and CSS in general,
if you like the idea [subscribing](https://a.st/yt) would help me a lot ✌️

I also have a full time job as front-end developer at the award winning agency @sunnyatsea
